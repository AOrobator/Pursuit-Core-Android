# Coding Style

AC3.3 uses the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for all Java code. Students should be familiar with this style and format Java code accordingly in all exercises, projects, homework submissions, and assessments.

## Highlights

- Line length limited to 100 characters.
- Two-space indent.  **No tabs.**
- Spaces around operators.
- Space after `if`, `for`, `while`.
- Use `{` and `}` even for one-line blocks.
- Opening `{` on the same line.
- `} else` on the same line.
- Uppercase `CamelCase` for class names.
- Lowercase `camelCase` for variable names.
- `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constant names.
-  `alllowercase` for package names.
