# Lecture

Before we can begin to study software development, we'll need to set up our work environment. A work environment consists of many factors (computer settings, plugins, access keys, passwords, etc.) which must be set up effectively before development can take place.

Since our Android development journey will begin with learning how to utilize the Java Programming language, we'll need to download something called the Java Development Kit, or **JDK** for short. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java programs. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed to program in Java.

### Installing the Oracle Java JDK

* Download the JDK from the [Oracle website here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
	* Accept the license aggreement by selecting "Accept the license aggreement"
	* Download the DMG file required for Mac OS X x64
* After downloading the DMG, click on the Desktop icon, and follow directions

Once this is done, the JDK should be installed on your system. However, since we will be developing primarily in the IDE IntelliJ, we won't need to do additional setup, the way we might have had to do in the past (add Java to our PATH, etc.), we can simply move on to the next step, and install the software we'll use to actually write Java code.

The software we'll use to write and run Java code is called an Integrated Development Environment, or **IDE** for short. The name of the particular IDE we'll use to learn Java is called IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains.

### Installing IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

 * Download the DMG file for the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from the [JetBrains website here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
 * Once installed, open the application for the first time
 * On the Startup page, select: `Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure`
 * Under "Project SDK", the option `<No SDK>` should be selected. To the right, press `New > JDK`, then find the location of the directory with the JDK installed/downloaded on your computer. Select it, then press "OK"
 * Once the JDK has been selected, press "Apply", and then "OK" to complete the settings, and close the window
 
## Next Steps

If you have completed installing both of these items, then you should be well-prepared for the beginning of Unit 1! However, you'll still need to sign up for the following sites:

* Slack
* GitHub
* Canvas
* HackerRank
* CodingBat
* Repl.it
* StackOverFlow (optional)

Please confirm with your PM to make sure that you have received the appropriate links to sign up for your cohort's Slack and Canvas accounts, and please confirm that you have active GitHub, HackerRank, CodingBat, Repl.it, and StackOverflow accounts.

Once you have completed all of these steps, please reach out to your PM or other staff members for more information. Good Luck!
