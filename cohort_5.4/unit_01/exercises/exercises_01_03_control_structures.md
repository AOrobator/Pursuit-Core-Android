#### 01.03.01

Declare a variable of the type `boolean` in the `main(String[] args)` method. Name the variable `isTurtlePerson`. Assign it a value of `true`. 

Using an `if/else` statement, write logic that will print the phrase `I like Turtles` if the value of `isTurtlePerson` is `true`, and print the phrase `I do not like Turtles` if the value of `isTurtlePerson` is `false`.

Copy and paste the code you wrote below.

Declare two variables of the type `boolean` in the `main(String[] args)` method. Name the first variable `isWarm`. Name the second variable `isRainy`. Assign them both `boolean` values of your choice. 

Using an `if/else` statement, write logic that will:

* print the phrase `Bring an umbrella` if the value of `isWarm` is `true`, and the value of `isRainy` is `true`
* print the phrase `Wear a T-Shirt` if the value of `isWarm` is `true`, and the value of `isRainy` is `false`
* print the phrase `Wear a Raincoat` if the value of `isWarm` is `false`, and the value of `isRainy` is `true`
* print the phrase `Wear a Windbreaker` if the value of `isWarm` is `false`, and the value of `isRainy` is `false`
 
 Copy and paste the code you wrote below.

In the `main(String[] args)` method - declare a variable named `score` of type  `int`, and assign it a ternary operator expression, with the following condition:

* if the number 10 is greater than the number 5, then provide the number `100`, otherwise provide the number `0`. 
* Print the value of score to the screen

Copy and paste the code you wrote below.

#### 01.03.04 

In the `main(String[] args)` method - declare a variable named `grade` of type  `char`, and assign it a value of `'A'`.

Compose a `switch` statement that, when provided with the variable `grade`:

* when `grade` is `'A'`, print "Great Job!"
* when `grade` is `'B'`, print "Good Work!"
* when `grade` is `'C'`, print "Okay - but needs improvement!"
* when `grade` is `'D'`, print "You can do better - don't give up!"
* when `grade` is `'F'`, print "Please see me after class."
* when `grade` is none of those values, print "Invalid Input"

Copy and paste the code you wrote below.

#### 01.03.05

In the `main(String[] args)` method - declare a variable named `number` of type  `int`, and assign it a value of `0`.

Compose an `if/else` statement that, when provided with the variable `number`:

* will print the phrase "positive even" to the screen if the number is even, and greater than `0`
* will print the phrase "positive odd" to the screen if the number is odd, and greater than `0`
* will print the phrase "negative even" to the screen if the number is even, and less than `0`
* will print the phrase "negative odd" to the screen if the number is even, and less than `0`
