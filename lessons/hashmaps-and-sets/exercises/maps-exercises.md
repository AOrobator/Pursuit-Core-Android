Please work through these exercises, completing as many as you can in class.  

1. **Finish moons:** Finish the hashmap of number of moons for each planet.

1. **Moons as method:** Convert this to a _method_ that _returns_ this hashmap.  It should look like this:

  ```java
  public static HashMap<String, Integer> getNumberOfMoons() {
      // Write code here!
  }
