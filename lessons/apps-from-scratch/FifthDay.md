- title: Building an App from Scratch
- tags: java, android, app

# Objectives
- Exposure to a realistic interview assignment


# Lecture
Today we will be revisiting the test which we took before the New Year. <br>
We will be dividing the class into two groups of similar performing students, and as a group will work through the assignment. <br>
The groups will be divided based on previous App from Scratch submissions.

Things to note:
- We are working as a group on individual projects. Hence, everyone should have a 
project to submit at the end of class.
- Students will begin demonstrating their app from scratch code bases in front 
of the class. This will prepare you to defend code decisions during whiteboarding
exercises. Do not write code you can't defend.
- There are as many ways to solve App from Scratch problems, as there are programmers.
It is important to collaborate on how interesting things (data from internet or 
a user click) propagate through the app and interact with activities, fragments, 
and views. There is no reason to copy someone else's code base just because it 
is farther along than your own. You learn more by fixing your own custom architecture.

# Assignment
Complete the entire test. <br>
This includes the extra credit.<br>
Do not copy and paste from a previous project (Start with a default Android template).<br> 
Make a git commit when you first start the project and at MOST every ten minutes. <br>

After completing the test, you will refactor your code base according to feedback from the instructors. <br>
Then you will be given an alternative assignment, building a custom application and diagraming the architecture.
