## Objectives
* Fellows will pull data from JSON endpoint using Retrofit
* Fellows will create data models to map to that JSON Data
* Fellows will display that data as an image from a website using Picasso

## Resources

* [JSON and JSON Parsing - The Old School Way](https://github.com/C4Q/AC-Android/tree/master/lessons/json/json_parsing)
