# Lecture

During this lecture, we will build a recycler view that displays a list of items. After selecting an item in the list, a user will
navigate to the fragment that list item represents.

Each list item will be generated from [EmployeeDescription](
https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook/EmployeeDescription.java), a class that represents an individual worker of the grocery store.


It is important to understand how all the classes in the [EmployeeHandbook](https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/tree/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook) package relate.

- Where is the RecyclerView created
- How is the RecyclerView Adapter related to the RecyclerView
- What is the purpose of [EmployeeViewHolder](https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook/EmployeeViewHolder.java)
- Where does the data for [onBindViewHolder](https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook/EmployeeListAdapter.java#L31) come from?
- What is the purpose of the [bind](https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook/EmployeeViewHolder.java#L29) function?

## Assignment
- Add an employee description representing yourself.
- Modify the codebase to launch an [EmployeeView](https://github.com/JsjRoboticsClassroom/AndroidGroceryStore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nyc/c4q/grocerystore/employeeHandbook/EmployeeView.java) activity when your employee description is selected.
- Modify the EmployeeView class so that when it is launched with only your Employee Description, it will display your fragment.
