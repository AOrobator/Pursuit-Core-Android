# RecyclerView Review (viewviewviewviewview..)

#### Overview
Having worked out the different parts of the RecyclerView and understanding the overall idea of it, is just part of implementing it. This lesson will be focused on hands-on practice with implementation. Each student will be tasked with implementing their own recyclerview and pushing it to their own github repo.

The practice of actually going in and typing out each line of code cannot be understated. It is through this practice that you will refine your programming skills and that is what we will focus on for this class. 

Feel free to refer to previous lessons on the recyclewview, the objective is for you to learn it and to be comfortable implementing the component.

#### Morning Exercise ( From previous Saturday )

Many people went straight to working on their homework last saturday, in this class, please do not work on your homework until you implement a basic recyclerview and push it to github. Again, rememeber that actually typing things out will only help you. Copying and pasting from other projects will only do you a diservice since you will gain only a passing if any understanding of the component implementation. TAs and I will be there to help you, even if you are completely lost, our job is to make sure you all understand this, so don't be shy to ask any questions.

(from previous saturday): 
```
Cleate a sample application that uses the recyclerview much like the sample app, remember that a lot of your programming skill will come not only from understanding concepts but also from implementing them. 

Things to try:
* Make your list scroll horizontally
* flesh out your view holders. (add images!)
* add buttons to your view holder and make something cool happen when a button is clicked!
```

If it all goes well, in the afternoon we will spend some time going through previous student projects, reviewing architecture, and basic programming principles. Having done that fellows will have time to work on their homework.
