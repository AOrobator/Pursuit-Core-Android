# Lecture

To quote an applicable movie reference:

**Colette:** I know the Gusteau style cold. In every dish, Chef Gusteau always has something unexpected. I will show you. I memorize all his recipe.

**Linguini:** (writing in notebook) Always do something unexpected.

**Colette:** No. Follow the recipe.

**Linguini:** But you just said that...

**Colette:** (interrupts) No-no-no-no. It was *his* job to be unexpected. It is *our* job to...

**Colette, Linguini:** (together, as Linguini rewrites the advice) ... follow the recipe.

## Practice, then Improvise

As with any skill, it's important to figure out the bare minimum for what is necessary to gain this skill, rather than seeking to be an expert from the very beginning.

The famous 18th century catholic polyglot, Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, spoke 30-plus languages fluently, and was familiar with upwards of 42 languages. He did this by taking the *Pater Noster* prayer, and painstakingly translating it into every new language he wanted to learn, to break down the individual steps that made each language unique.

Elon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal, and current CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla, referred to this technique as **first principles** - he is quoted as once saying "you boil things down to the most fundamental truths... and then reason up from there."

The same can be said for learning to code, especially views like Android's RecyclerView. We will break down the RecyclerView into simple, atomic, elemental steps - then, as you grow as developers, you'll be able to modify these steps to best fit your needs (make things clickable, move to other Activities, add pictures), and eventually read the source code, to make incredible things. So, let's begin:

### 1. Create a Model Class for the Data you want to Display

To separate concerns effectively, we should create a package called **model** (all lowercase) within our project just for our data models - or what we want our data to look like for use.

Next, we'll make a basic data class to store inside of our new package - a class for fun movies. It should have:

* Field variables for the title, director, and debut year
* Public Constructor to set the fields
* Getters for each instance field

```java
package nyc.c4q.recyclerviewexample.model;

public class Movie {
    String title;
    String director;
    String year;

    public Movie(String title, String director, String year) {
        this.title = title;
        this.director = director;
        this.year = year;
    }
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    public String getDirector() {
        return director;
    }
    public String getYear() {
        return year;
    }
}
```

### 2. Insert a dependency into your app's build.gradle file

Oh, Gradle - the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems. First, add this line of code to your app's build.gradle dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.+'
```

If you've updated to Android Studio 3.0, you might have to add this line instead:

```groovy
implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.+'
```

This will add the library to your build for use. This is a good thing. Once done, sync your gradle files.

### 3. Insert RecyclerView XML Widget

Go to the Activity layout xml file (or wherever you want your RecyclerView to be seen), and create a RecyclerView Widget:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context="nyc.c4q.recyclerviewexample.MainActivity">

    <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/movie_recyclerview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"/>

</android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout>
```
 Make sure to give your RecyclerView widget an ID that makes sense (as with all your widgets), so that it will be easier to find in the future. You'll thank me later.

## 4. Reference the RecyclerView in your Activity's onCreate()

Like so:

```java
RecyclerView movieRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.movie_recyclerview);
```

## 5. Create an ItemView Layout

Next, we'll want to create a container layout file, to organize our data, and repeat over-and-over again for display. We'll call it movie_itemview.xml, and store it in our layout resource folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:id="@+id/movie_itemview"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="100dp"
              android:orientation="vertical">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/movie_title_textview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        android:layout_weight="1"/>

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/movie_director_textview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        android:layout_weight="1"/>

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/movie_year_textview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        android:layout_weight="1"/>

</LinearLayout>
```

### 6. Create a ViewHolder Class to set these view values dynamically

Next, create a ViewHolder class, to set the values of the views within the itemview dynamically. Make sure to "extends" from RecyclerView.ViewHolder:

```java
package nyc.c4q.recyclerviewexample.view;

import android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.TextView;

import nyc.c4q.recyclerviewexample.R;
import nyc.c4q.recyclerviewexample.model.Movie;

public class MovieViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder{

    private TextView title;
    private TextView director;
    private TextView year;

    public MovieViewHolder(View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.movie_title_textview);
        director = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.movie_director_textview);
        year = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.movie_year_textview);
    }
}
```
