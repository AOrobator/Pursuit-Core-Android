# Objectives
- Identify recursion as a solution to problems
- Identify when recursion is and is not appropriate

# Lecture
Today we will solve several recursive problems.

```
     Given a number, write a recursive function that will print
     all valid  arrangements of parenthesis, if the number represents
     the closed pairs of parenthesis. For example

     parenthesis(3) should print

      ()()(), (()()), ((())), 
      
      parenthesis(4) should print
      
      ()()()(), (()()()), ((())()), (()(())), (((())))
```

```
     Given a string that represents a Roman Numeral, write a recursive function that will print
     the decimal representation of the number
```

```
     Write a function that recursively calculates the factorial of a number.
```
