# Lecture

The goal of this lesson is to practice and prepare for next Saturday's DS+A Quest. Topics of review for the quest include:

- Iterating through a two-dimensional array.
- Using recursion to solve problems.
- Traversing a linked list to count nodes and/or search for a target value.
- Analyzing Big-O runtime complexities.

## Arrays & 2D Arrays

**1)** Write a method that returns a two-dimensional array representing a random grayscale image using the ░, ▒, and ▓ characters. Your method should accept an `int x` and `int y` as parameters that determine the width and height of the image.

**2)** Write a method that returns a two-dimensional array that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each element there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board. Iterating over the entire 2D array and printing each character should show something like this:

```
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
```

When you have a method that generates this pattern, define a parameter `int size` so that it works for any size (not just 8), outputting a grid of the given width and height.

**3)** Write a method `int[][] addPairs(int[] array, int k)` that receives an array of numbers and returns all the pairs that sum up to a specified value `k`. What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your solution?

```java
pairSums(new int[]{-3, 4, 2, 1, 6, -1}, 3) // returns {{-3, 6}, {4, -1}, {2, 1}}
pairSums(new int[]{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, 10) // returns {{0, 10}, {2, 8}, {4, 6}}
```

## Recursion

**1)** Given a string, compute recursively (no loops) a new string where all the lowercase 'x' chars have been changed to 'y' chars.

```java
changeXY("codex") → "codey"
changeXY("xxhixx") → "yyhiyy"
changeXY("xhixhix") → "yhiyhiy"
```

**2)** Write a method `String removeDuplicates(String input)` that receives a string and **RECURSIVELY** removes any **CONSECUTIVE** duplicates.

```java
removeDuplicates("access"); // returns "aces"
removeDuplicates("code"); // returns "code"
removeDuplicates("awwhhhh yeahhhhhhhh"); // returns "awh yeah"
```

**3)** Complete [isEvenWord()](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24773027/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-03%20at%2011.40.57%20AM.png).

## Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues

**1)** Summarize the differences and similarities between a:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

**2)** Write a method `listLength(Node list)` that receives the head of a singly linked list and returns the number of nodes in the linked list. What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your algorithm?

```java
Node next;
Object data;

public Node(Object data) { 
	this.value = data;
	this.next = null ;
} 

Node list = new Node("Apple");
list.next = new Node("Orange") 
list.next.next = new Node("Banana");
list.next.next.next = new Node("Carrot");
list.next.next.next.next = new Node("Beet");
 
listLength(list); // returns 5 
``` 

**3)** Write a method called `searchLinkedList(Node head, Object target)` that receives the head of a linked list and target search value, and returns `true` if the target is in the list, or `false` if the target is not in the list. What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your algorithm?

```java
searchLinkedList(list, "Apple"); // returns true
searchLinkedList(list, "Pear"); // returns false
```

**4)** Can you traverse a singly-linked list backwards? What about a circular singly-linked list?

**5)**  Write a `moveToTop` function that takes in a queue and a value, and moves that value to the top of the queue.

## Big-O

**1)** Is it always better to choose an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` over one that runs in `O(n²)`? Why or why not?

**2)** Why do you think that we analyze algorithms from a theoretical standpoint using Big-O notation, instead of just counting runtime in seconds or the like?

**3)** In what ways does this adherence to Big-O (disregarding constants and lower order terms) hinder our ability to speak about algorithms in the real world?

**4)** How might we use runtime complexity analysis to our benefit as programmers before we even write any code?

**5)** Which of the following is **NOT** equivalent to a time complexity of 0(n)?
- O(2n)
- O(n^2)
- O(n/2)
- O(n + m) where m < n

## Tries (advanced)

If you're feeling comfortable with the above DS + A review material, move ahead to the [Trie project](tries.md).
