- Learn common design patterns in Android


# Lecture
Today we will be reviewing the necessary skills for passing the midterm and final exam.

[An example final exam is here](FinalExamDraft.pdf).

We will be writing a sample Android app, writing test code for it, and discussing various design patterns against it.

- [Android Testing Resources](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/index.html)
- [Android JUnit Example](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing/tree/master/runner/AndroidJunitRunnerSample)

We will also discuss design patterns for code. Design patterns are patterns that can be used to solve a generic problem.

Though the above linked post talks specifically about Scala, the design patterns are relevant to Java as well.
