“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.”

#### Exercise 1: 

We will start by cloning the following [repo](https://github.com/abassawo/SaturdayCodeLab.git) and pulling from the fib branch.

Isolate the bug in this repo, and work with a partner to fix it.


Collectively, we will work on improving our solutions to this.


#### Exercise 2:

Visit [The Star Wars API] (http://swapi.co/)

Feel free to clone the StarwarsCodeLab [repo](https://github.com/abassawo/StarwarsCodeLab) or create a new repo.

Together, we will use our debugging skills to find any errors, and finish with a UI representative of the data contained in the API.
