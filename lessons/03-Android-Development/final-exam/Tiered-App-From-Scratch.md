# Lecture

Yesterday in class, several volunteers helped to build an app that incorporates the features needed to pass the final.
Today, everybody will be building an app individually, so that you will have reference code to work from.

During development, it is important to pay attention to view padding, width, height and other attributes.
After each app we build, I will be explicitly changing the sizes of some views. 
I am expecting this change to take less than 5 seconds for you to implement in your code base, across all views that require it.
