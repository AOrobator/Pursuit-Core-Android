# Morning Challenge

A ***factorial*** of a number `n` is defined as the product of `n` and all positive integers below `n`. For example:

```
factorial(5) =

5! =

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 =

120
```

Write a method `long factorial(long n)` that **iteratively** (using loops) calculates and returns the factorial of `n`. What is the runtime complexity of your solution? What about the space complexity?

*Keep in mind that factorial(0) = 1*
