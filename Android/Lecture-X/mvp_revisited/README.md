[Test Json](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/simulation/simulation_test.json)

The following assignment is the same as previously completed in class. However, during
todays lecture, we will discuss design decisions, separation of concerns, and code
structure in far more detail.

Make notes of the following:

- Constants
- Naming conventions
- Scope of variables
- class hierarchy
- classes per file
- saving state
- call back functions


The assignment is to build an app with two screens. The first screen should show the list of posts received from the above url.
The list should display the post id, title, excerpt, and date. By clicking on the post, a new screen should display the
post id, title, content and date.

The app should work in both portrait and landscape.
