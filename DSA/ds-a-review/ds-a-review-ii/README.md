# Objectives

- Gain hands-on practice in solving linked list, stack, queue, array and recursion exercises.
- Prepare for the DS+A Quest!

# Lecture

The goal of this lesson is to practice and prepare for the upcoming DS+A portion of the final exam, which will be worth 25% of your final exam grade. Topics of review include:

- Understanding the properties and use cases of common data structures including hash maps, arrays, lists, stacks, and queues. 
- Traversing a linked list to count nodes and/or search for a target value.
- Using recursion to solve problems.
- Analyzing Big-O runtime complexities and describing why Big-O is important.

# Exercises

1) For each of the following use cases, name the data structure that would be most useful and describe why:

a. A phone book that maps names to phone numbers.

b. An alphabetical list of all the students in a class.

c. A playlist of songs.

d. A browser cache which allows you to hit the "back" button.

e. Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word.

f. A deck of playing cards.

## Recursion

1) Implement a program that counts from 1 to 10, printing out each number, without using loops.

2) Write a recursive method called `recursiveZip` that zips two strings. You should not use `for` loops, `while` loops, or any other non-recursive methods.

```
recursiveZip("cat", "dog"); // "cdaotg"
recursiveZip("acegi", "bdfhj"); // "abcdefghij"

```

3)  Given a string that represents a [Roman Numeral](http://literacy.kent.edu/Minigrants/Cinci/romanchart.htm), write a recursive method that will print the decimal representation of the number.

## Big-O

1) Why is analyzing Big-O runtime useful?

2) What is the Big O runtime for each of your solutions to the problems above?
