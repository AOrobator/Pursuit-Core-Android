# Title: MultiThreading
Tags: multithreading, concurrency

# Objectives

* Life Cycle of a Thread
* Be able to create and use a Thread
* Be able to manage multiple threads

### Show me the threads!

# Resources

- [Java Concurrency](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html)

---

# Concurrency vs Parrellism

Concurrency is *dealing* with many things as once. For example: you laptop is managing the needs of multiple applications at once (not necessarily at the same time).

Parrellism is *doing* many things at once. For example: Dividing the work of cleaning a big hall between multiple people. They all pick their sections and can all clean at once.

# What is Thread in java

*def* A thread is a lightweight sub process, a smallest unit of processing. It is a separate path of execution.

Threads are independent, if there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It shares a common memory area.

---
 
![Multithreading](multithreading.jpg)

As shown in the above figure, thread is executed inside the process. There is context-switching between the threads. There can be multiple processes inside the OS and one process can have multiple threads.

---

# What is MultiThreading

*def* Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

Benefits:

* It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at same time.

* You can perform many operations together so it saves time.

* Threads are independent so it doesn't affect other threads if exception occur in a single thread.

---

# When to use threads

### Threads make work fast, why not use it all time!
(The Cleaners Problem)

* Asynchronous operations

* Operations that can be parallelized

* Continual running background operations

---

# Simple Java Thread code

```java
class Multi3 implements Runnable{  
    public void run(){  
        System.out.println("thread is running...");  
    }  
  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Multi3 m1=new Multi3();  
        Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);  
        t1.start(); 
        System.out.println("main is done"); 
    }  
}  
```

---

# Life cycle of a Thread (Thread States)

* New : The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.

* Runnable : A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.

* Blocked : This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.

* Terminated: A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.

Other states may exist such as "waiting", "timed_waiting"

The life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM.

# Creating a Thread via Runnable Interface

The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. Runnable interface have only one method named `run()`.

`public void run()`: is used to perform action for a thread.

```java
class Multi3 implements Runnable{  
    public void run(){  
        System.out.println("thread is running...");  
    }  
  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Multi3 m1=new Multi3();  
        Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);  
        t1.start();  
    }  
}  
```

---

### You can also extend the `Thread` class to create a thread.

```java
class Multi extends Thread{  
    public void run(){  
        System.out.println("thread is running...");  
    }  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Multi t1=new Multi();  
        t1.start();  
    }  
} 
```

---

# Commonly used methods of Thread:

* `public void run()`: is used to perform action for a thread.

* `public void start()`: starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.

* `public void sleep(long miliseconds)`: Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.

* `public void join()`: waits for a thread to die.

* `public String getName()`: returns the name of the thread.

* `public void setName(String name)`: changes the name of the thread.

* `public Thread currentThread()`: returns the reference of currently executing thread.

* `public Thread.State getState()`: returns the state of the thread.

---

# Commonly used methods of Threads contd.

* `public boolean isAlive()`: tests if the thread is alive.

* `public void yield()`: causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.

* `public void suspend()`: is used to suspend the thread(depricated).

* `public void resume()`: is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).

* `public void stop()`: is used to stop the thread(depricated).

* `public void interrupt()`: interrupts the thread.

# Problem

Write a program called SharedCounter.java in which 10 threads each increment a shared int counter 1000 times. 

When all the threads have finished, print the final value of the counter. Counter is initialized to zero and you should always get 10000 

Do you always get 1000? If not why?
`hide` You will not always get 1000 due to race condition between the threads.

How can we ensure we always get 1000?
`hide` By protecting the increment block using `synchronize`

---

# Problem

Below is the algorithm to check if a number is prime.
It returns -1 when it's input is prime or the factor when not prime.

```java
int IsPrime(int n) {
    if (n < 1) return -1;
    if (i == 1) return -1;

    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

Create a program that takes numbers from user and returns "X Is Prime" if the number is prime or "X Is Divisible by Y" when it is not prime.

```
Input: 2,5,100,101
Output:
2 Is Prime
5 Is Prime
100 Is Divisible by 2
101 Is Prime
```

Time the program so that at the end of the output it would also print:
```
Time taken ZZZ seconds
```

Speed up the program using threads. You should have at most four threads and the work needs to be spread evenly between them.

You can not have more threads than you have numbers.

---

# Problem 

Create a program that takes a number and outputs all prime numbers from 1 to that number and the time taken to perform the computation.

```
// sample run:
Input: 10
Output: [1,2,3,5,7] in 0.02 secs
```

How long does it take to compute the primes in 1 million? 1 billion?

Speed up the program using threads.

---

# Problem

Create a file downloader program that takes a URL as input, downloads and saves the file at that url to your Downloads directory.

*Some part of the code for downloading files would be provided to you*

If the file already exists, prompt user before overwriting it.

Also, the user may want to download multiple large files, he doesn't want to wait for one to finish before another download can start.

He wants to just queue up as many downloads as he can than leave it for lunch to run on it own.

How would you solve this problem using threads?

---

# Problem 


Create a program that allows a user to add new words to a system dictionary. Use this [dictionary file](dictionary.txt).

The dictionary is used by several applications on our system so words can be added to it at anytime by any other application, say MS Word.

It is important that no application hauds the dictionary and prevent apps from reading/modifying it.

When user enters a word that is already in the dictionary, the program should print "Found in X seconds" where X is time taken to find the word.

If the user enters a word that is *not* already in the dictionary, the program should print "Added new word 'WORD' in X seconds"

To make the prompt appear fast, the work of reading and writing to the file should be done outside the main thread.

# Exercises

**Question 1**
Write a program called SharedCounter.java in which 10 threads each increment a shared int counter 1000 times. When all the threads have finished, print the final value of the counter. Counter is initialized to zero and you should always get 10000 

[Further] Arrange for your code to sometimes print the wrong answer. (Hint: try using some well-placed calls to Thread.yield() or Thread.sleep().)
