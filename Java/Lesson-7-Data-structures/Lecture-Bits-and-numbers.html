# Lecture: Bits and Numbers
#### Data structures and algorithms

# Warm 

Create a generic list class MyList that extends ArrayList.
* Add a constructure with a parameter of T and initialize the list with the parameters
* Add a constructure to allow adding arbitrary number of arguments

# Objectives

- Represent numbers in base 2, 10 and 16
- Convert numbers in one base to another base

# What is a Base?

A *Base* is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. 

For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the base is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9
The binary system (base 2) uses the digits 0 and 1.

# Counting in Different Bases

When we write a normal (base 10) number, like 5763, we mean the value:

    5000+700+60+3

In a more (positional) form:

    5⋅10^3 + 7⋅10^2 + 6⋅10^1 + 3⋅10^0

* 5763 is not a valid number is binary. Is it valid in Octal (8)?

# Counting in Different Bases (contd)

Simple addition with carry over

```
  56
+ 25
----
  81
```

Is it possible to perform a decimal addition that will carry more than 9?
Add two binary numbers 11 and 10. Tip convert to decimal before and after adding to verify result

# Storage Introduction

* We store information on computer by turning transistors on and off.  
* We represent the on/off state as 0 and 1 (the order matters not for our purposes)

* A *bit* is the smallest unit of information that can be stored
* 8 bits make a *byte*

```
0 ~ One bit
10100101 ~ One byte (8 bits)
```


Let's take a look at how we are able to store numbers by breaking them down to 0s and 1s.

---

# Binary

* Whenever you here 0s and 1s... they're talking binary - machine language (don't listen)

Here is how we would represent 439 in base 10:
439 = 400 + 30 + 9 (brain makes this up)
    = 4 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^0 (the real thing)

# Binary (contd)

Let's break up some more *decimal* numbers!

29, 940, 10, 10000, 1000000, 2048

```
29 = 2 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^0
940 = 9 * 10^2 + 4 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0
10 = 1 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0
10000 = 1 * 10^4 + 0 * 10^3 + 0 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0
1000000 = 1 * 10^6 + 0 * 10^5 + 0 * 10^4 + 0 * 10^3 + 0 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0
2048 = 2 * 10^3^ + 0 * 10^2^ + 4 * 10^1^ + 8 * 10^0^
832941 = 8 * 10^5 + 3 * 10^4 + 2 * 10^3 + 9 * 10^2 + 4 * 10^1 + 1 * 10^0

```

# Binary (contd)

Let's take a look at a binary number: 11001 

How can we calculate its value in base ten?


2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
 1     1     0     0     1
            
<details>
<summary><b>Click Here to Toggle Solution</b></summary>
11001 = 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1* 2^0

11001 = 16 + 8 + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + 1

11001 = 25
